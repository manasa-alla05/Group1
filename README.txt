## Object Detection with Faster R-CNN
This project is a Python-based application that uses Faster R-CNN for object detection. It allows you to upload an image, run the object detection model, and display the detected objects along with their class labels.

## Overview
The Object Detection App leverages PyTorch and torchvision to use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model with a ResNet50 backbone for object detection. The application processes an uploaded image, detects objects, and displays the image with bounding boxes around detected objects. Additionally, it fetches the COCO dataset annotations to label detected objects

## Features
Upload and process an image for object detection.
Use a pre-trained Faster R-CNN model for object detection.
Annotate objects in the image with bounding boxes and class labels.
Fetch and use COCO dataset annotations for labeling

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 1.10+
- Torchvision 0.11+
- OpenCV 4.5+
- PIL
- pycocotools
- requests
- zipfile
- google.colab

## Usage

1. Open the Grouop1.ipynb file in Google colab
2. Run the cell: Start by running the cell and then upload an image from the given images mentioned in the folder. The image will be processed by the Faster R-CNN model for object detection.

## Output Generation Process

*  Object Detection: The model will run inference on the uploaded image. Bounding boxes will be drawn around detected objects, and their class labels will be shown based on the COCO dataset.
*  View Detected Objects: The image with bounding boxes and labels will be displayed in the Colab notebook.
*  COCO Annotations: If the COCO annotations are not already available, the application will automatically download and extract them to annotate the detected objects.

## Example Output

The program will display the processed image with bounding boxes and class labels like the following:

* A bounding box around a detected "dog" in the image.
* Labels for detected objects like "car", "cat", etc., using the COCO dataset labels.
